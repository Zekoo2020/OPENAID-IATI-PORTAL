			<p class="intro">In September 2011 the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs started publishing data on all the development aid projects it finances. The data is published in the international <a href="http://www.iatistandard.org" target="_blank">IATI standard</a> which is easy for computers to read, but very hard for humans. On openaid.nl this information is made accessible through a web interface.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.zimmermanzimmerman.nl" target="_blank">Zimmerman &amp; Zimmerman</a> is a dutch open-data visualisation company based in Amsterdam that develops opensource IATI tools, such as transparency portals for <a target="_blank" href="http://opendata.unesco.org">open UNESCO</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://open.unhabitat.org">open UN-Habitat</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://urbandata.unhabitat.org">Urban data portal</a> for UN-Habitat. All these tools run on an Open IATI Parser and API called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oipa.nl">OIPA</a>, which was developed by Zimmerman &amp; Zimmerman. They where responsible for developing the concept, the design and the technical development of openaidNL.</p>

			<h4>What data can I find on openaidNL?</h4>
			<p>This platform extracts the raw IATI data published by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the IATI registry, and presents it in an easy-to-use web interface. It does not alter or interpret the data in any way.</p>

			<h4>Why is open data important?</h4>
			<p>Transparency of development aid enhances the effectiveness and quality of development aid. Governments of developing countries are able to plan better when they have access to accurate and up-to-date information about aid flows into their countries. Citizens in developing countries can hold their governments accountable for the spending of aid. The Dutch public gets a better picture of how public  money is spent.</p>

			<p>The value of open data is greatly increased if it can be compared and added up internationally. The International Aid Transparancy Initiative (IATI) aims to do just that â€“ to develop an international standard for the publication of aid data.</p>
			
			
			<p>Openaid.nl was iniated by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.akvo.org">Akvo.org</a> back in 2011 and commissioned Zimmerman & Zimmerman to build and maintain the the OIPA codebase</p>
